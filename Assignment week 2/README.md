# 🐧 Week-2 - Linux

Welcome to Week-2 of our journey into the world of Linux! This week, we will dive deep into the fundamental aspects of Linux, exploring its history, key concepts, distributions, and essential commands. Let's get started! 🚀

## 📜 Introduction to Linux and Its History

Linux is a powerful and flexible operating system with a rich history. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free and open-source alternative to UNIX. Over the years, Linux has grown into a robust OS used in servers, desktops, and even mobile devices.

## 💻 What is a Shell and Its Types?

A shell is a command-line interface used to interact with the operating system. It allows users to execute commands and run scripts. There are several types of shells:

- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**: The most common shell in Linux distributions.
- **Zsh (Z Shell)**: Known for its customization features.
- **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)**: Offers user-friendly features out of the box.

## 🐧 Different Linux Distributions

Linux comes in various distributions (distros), each tailored for different needs and preferences. Some popular ones include:

- **Ubuntu**: User-friendly and widely used for desktops and servers.
- **CentOS**: Enterprise-focused, stable, and free.
- **Debian**: Known for its stability and vast software repository.

## 🛠️ Installing a Linux Distribution

To install a Linux distribution, follow these general steps:

1. **Download the ISO file** of your chosen distro from its official website.
2. **Create a bootable USB drive** using tools like Rufus or Etcher.
3. **Boot from the USB drive** and follow the installation instructions provided by the distro.

## 📂 Navigating the Linux File System

The Linux file system is hierarchical, starting from the root (`/`) directory. Here are some key directories:

- `/home`: User home directories.
- `/etc`: Configuration files.
- `/var`: Variable files like logs.
- `/usr`: User binaries and applications.

## 🗂️ File Hierarchy in Linux System

Understanding the Linux file hierarchy is crucial for effective navigation and management:

- `/`: Root directory.
- `/bin`: Essential command binaries.
- `/sbin`: System binaries.
- `/lib`: Shared libraries.

## 📝 Basic Commands of Linux

Here are some fundamental Linux commands:

- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `cd`: Change directory.
- `pwd`: Print working directory.
- `cp`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv`: Move/rename files or directories.
- `rm`: Remove files or directories.
- `chmod`: Change file permissions.
- `chown`: Change file owner.

## 👥 Users and Group Management in Linux

Managing users and groups is vital for system security and organization:

- `adduser`: Add a new user.
- `deluser`: Delete a user.
- `usermod`: Modify a user.
- `groupadd`: Add a new group.
- `groupdel`: Delete a group.
- `groups`: Show a user's groups.

## 🔐 Permission Management in Linux

Linux uses a permission model to secure files and directories. Permissions include:

- **Read (r)**: View the contents.
- **Write (w)**: Modify the contents.
- **Execute (x)**: Run the file as a program.

Commands to manage permissions:

- `chmod`: Change the permissions of a file.

  ```sh
  chmod 755 filename
